# SecretPass Sport

SecretPass Sport is a non-custodial credential management framework with support for local(version control) storage or through our [managed cloud](https://secretsport.cloud).

## How it works

- **Zero Knowledge**: Raw credentials and keys are never transmitted over the network or stored on local or cloud storage.
- **Local Encryption**: Data is locked and unlocked right on your device/server.
- **User Control**: If all the users were to lose their keys and the master recovery phrase(optional), your data will be unrecoverable.

### Control Keys

Sport supports multiple types of keys based on the device being used to access the secret and the security level.

- **Biometric Passkeys** - Passkeys stored on the user's device:
  - On Windows and Linux devices passkeys are stored on a **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip**.
  - On Apple Silicon Macs passkeys are stored in the built-in **Secure Enclave**
    - On Intel-based Macs the passkeys are stored on the **Apple T2 Security Chip**
  - Passkeys can be hardware bound or synced based on the OS and the level of security required.
- **Hardware Keys** - Dedicated hardware keys like YubiKey for the highest level of device bound security.
- **Machine Keys**
  - These are private keys authorised to access specific secrets for machine based workflows e.g. ai agents, your code, your CI workflows.
  - Since these keys are not as secure as Biometric Passkeys and Hardware Keys, restrict their scope to only what they need to access per environment or per individual secret

### Encryption Algorithms

Sport supports two major algorithms that can be used interchangeably based on the security needs of your project.

1. [X25519 + AES256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) - Classical elliptic-curve key exchange algorithm that is fast and secure on many types of hardware, it's not safe against future quantum computer attacks.
2. [ML-KEM-768 + AES256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML-KEM) - Post-quantum attack safe key-encapsulation mechanism; has relatively larger keys and cipher outputs but relatively fast computation in comparison to `X25519`.
3. Hybrid(`X25519` + `ML-KEM-768`) + AES256 - A combination of these 2 algorithms ensuring safety if either of the algorithms is ever compromised.
